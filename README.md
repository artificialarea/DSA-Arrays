# Working with arrays

_Pair: Michella + Sacha_

**[Thinkful Data Structures & Algorithms assignment](https://courses.thinkful.com/dsa-v1/checkpoint/4#assignment)**

To run any of these scripts, in terminal command line enter: `node script-name.js`

<br />

## 1. Implement an Array class from scratch





<br />

## 2. Explore the push() method

Array { length: 1, _capacity: 3, ptr: 0 }
Array { length: 5, _capacity: 12, ptr: 3 }
The length is 5 because we pushed 5 items and the capacity is 12 because after the fourth push the resize was called and increased capacity to 3X the original capacity.

??How is the pointer calculated the way it is


<br />

## 3. Exploring the pop() method

Array { length: 12, _capacity: 39, ptr: 15 }
 We popped 3 times which decreased the length by 3



<br />

## 4. Understanding more about how arrays work
First Item - 10
String prints as NaN because Array is defined as holding Floats only
Resize makes the array capable of holding more values by trippling in hopes that we don't need to do it often.

## 5. URLify a string

see: **`urlify.js`**



<br />

## 6. Filtering an array





<br />

## 7. Max sum in the array





<br />

## 8. Merge arrays





<br />

## 9. Remove characters




<br />

## 10. Products




<br />

## 11. 2D array




<br />

## 12. String rotation
